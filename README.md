### Hi there 👋




👋 Hi, I’m Mahalahatse. I'm still following maths and law studies. 
👀 I’m interested in computing and especially code but i am not developer, sorry !
🌱 I’m currently learning all things about development and specifically how to learn it.
☘️Actually, I'm learning at SAYNA in order to reach this goal. It's digital school to learn all digitals jobs with a good family spirit and game way.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on many projects to see all the methodology development in the world, good luck for me !
